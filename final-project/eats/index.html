						<p class="review-paragraph">Who doesn't love pizza? I could honestly eat it every single day without getting sick of it. New Yorkers are lucky. Really lucky, with even the "bad" pizza places being better than most pizza anywhere else. (I know, I know, we're insufferable but for good reason!)
						<p class="review-paragraph">Baker's has only been around for a little over two years but I think they have the best pizza in Alphabet City. And if you're expanding the neighborhood to include Joe's on 14th, okay, it'll come in second after them because Joe is KING! Baker's plain pie is fantastic, as well as the margherita and their namesake Baker's, but my absolute favorite is the Meatball Ricotta. Heavenly globs of ricotta, meatball, basil, garlic, parmesan and mozzarella - YUM!</p>
						<p id="order">Order this: Meatball Ricotta Pie and garlic knots</p>
